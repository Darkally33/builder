<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>To our little home away from home.
<p>Here, have a look at the <a href="http://imgur.com/a/gKqwD">newest
gallery for our server</a>. Or, if you're historically inclined, there
are some (unorganized) <a href="screenshots">pictures</a>
from <a href="https://www.brage.info/e9/">previous iterations</a> as
well.
<p>In case you're new here, Erisia is currently running a heavily
modified Modular Mayhem. Look at the tab list above, and you'll find
setup instructions as well as a live map.
<p>Erisia is a long-run survival server. This means that it's not
reset once per month &mdash; and usually not every three months,
either. We aim for each iteration to last around six months, but this
  number has crept steadily upwards over time.
<p>This means that you should build with an eye to architecture. If
you want to come in, 'win' the game, and then wait for the reset
&mdash; then so be it, we won't stop you, but the reset won't
happen. If you enjoy building beautiful cities, however, then Erisia
  may be the place for you.
<p>Cooperation is encouraged, though not enforced. We understand that
everyone has their own playstyle, and won't enforce our own views save
that any actions which might force a server reset will be
vetoed. However, Erisia has unusually
good <a href="https://status.brage.info/consoles/minecraft.html">monitoring</a>,
admin skill and backups, so you don't need to be afraid. Mistakes will
not be punished, and we won't lose your builds.
<p>The reason you should build in multiplayer, and not on your own, is because
visiting other people and discussing your builds is also fun, and often so
is collaboration. The reason you should do so here, and not on a different
server, is for the people you can find here.</p>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Griefing and nonconsensual PvP are both forbidden. If in doubt, don't do it.
  <li>Buildcraft Quarries, quarry-like autominers, etc. are all forbidden in the
    Overworld and Nether, due to their effect on the terrain and server lag. We recommend the Electrical Age
    autominer instead.<br>
    They are explicitly <em>not</em> forbidden in the
	  Deep Dark and Bedrock dimensions, but should be chunkloaded and removed when done. If unsure, ask.
	<li>Exploits are... inadvisable. If you are found to be using one, you may find that the results go poof, destroying hours of work.
	<li>At least <em>try</em> to make things look nice. There's
	  no requirement, but it'd improve your reputation.
  <li>To make road-building possible, all bases must be a <em>maximum</em> of
    2km from the nearest other base. To avoid FPS problems, 500m is a reasonable
    minimum, but if unsure ask your neighbour.
	<li>That said, have fun!
</ul>
Now, some limits on use of admin powers...
<ul>
	<li>Admin powers shall not be used except to fix obvious bugs or game-destroying situations.
	<li>If the game-destroying situation is "I got stuck in
	  Mystcraft" or "I ended up forty thousand kilometers out and
	  can't get back", then there's a mandatory half-hour timeout
	  prior to action and you don't get to keep your inventory.
	<li>Unless the audience unanimously thinks otherwise.
	<li>These rules are subject to change via supermajority
	  vote, with Baughn getting veto rights.
</ul>
