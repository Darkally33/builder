<h1>Getting started</h1>
<p>Erisia uses
  the <a href="http://mcupdater.com/">MCUpdater</a> framework
  for distributing pack updates.  Using this is moderately
  complex, compared to e.g. ATLauncher, but it also allows for
  quick updates.
<p>To get started:
  <ol>
    <li>First of all, make sure you join chat. The preferred option is <a href="https://discord.gg/VW9x7sR">Discord</a>. This
      channel is linked to the servers, and is an excellent place to get help or
      generally hang out.
    <li>Make sure you have 64-bit Java 8 installed.
    <li>Download and run <a href="MCU-Bootstrap.jar">MCU-Bootstrap</a>.
    <li>Select the correct instance from the instance list, on the left.
    <li>Take a look at the mods list. Many of these are optional. Defaults have
      been provided, but use your own judgement.
    <li>Click update
    <li>At the moment (iteration e31), we are running a 1.7.10 pack, which is not
      supported by MCUpdater. As a workaround, we suggest you install <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/">PrismLauncher</a>,
      and use it to run the game. A script is provided in the MCUpdater instance folder
      (find your MCU directory using the list below, then run the script in the e31/LiNKER folder)
      which will create a linked modpack entry in PrismLauncher. You will still need to
      use MCUpdater to recieve pack updates.
    <li>After you've updated the pack and run the link script, you may want to tweak the memory allocation of the pack in PrismLauncher.
      Default values are provided for the pack when the script creates a linked pack entry, but if you have the RAM
      for it, more memory may improve performance. Or you could reduce the memory consumption if you are using a weaker computer,
      though going below a maximum of 4GB is likely to cause problems.
    <li>Click launch.
  </ol>
<p>If you're lucky, this will let you into Erisia. If not, please make sure
  you're actually using 64-bit Java 8; if you aren't using that, you're going to
  need to delete the installation directory before trying again. Otherwise, ask
  for assistance in Discord.
<p>Depending on your OS, here's where to find it:
  <ul>
    <li>Linux: ~/.MCUpdater</li>
    <li>OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/MCUpdater</li>
    <li>Windows: %APPDATA%/.MCUpdater</li>
  </ul>
