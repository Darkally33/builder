<h1>Getting started</h1>
<p>Erisia uses
  the <a href="http://mcupdater.com/">MCUpdater</a> framework
  for distributing pack updates.  Using this is moderately
  complex, compared to e.g. ATLauncher, but it also allows for
  quick updates.
<p>To get started:
  <ol>
    <li>First of all, make sure you join irc.rizon.net channel #erisia. This
      channel is linked to the servers, and is an excellent place to get help or
      generally hang out. If you don't have a preferred IRC client, click the
      'IRC' link on the menubar.
    <li>Make sure you have 64-bit Java 8 installed. Java 9 may work, but will
    void your warranty.
    <li>Download and run <a href="MCU-Bootstrap.jar">MCU-Bootstrap</a>.
    <li>Select the correct instance from the instance list, on the left.
    <li>Take a look at the mods list. Many of these are optional. Defaults have
      been provided, but use your own judgement.<br>Better Foliage, for example,
      has a significant FPS impact on slower graphic processors.
    <li>Click update
    <li>After the update is done: In the settings screen, change max memory size
      to 4G (minimum, 8G is better) and permgen to 384M (minimum; I use
      512M). Click save. Do <em>not</em> change the minimum memory setting, only
      the maximum.
    <li>Click launch.
  </ol>
<p>If you're lucky, this will let you into Erisia. If not, please make sure
  you're actually using 64-bit Java 8; if you aren't using that, you're going to
  need to delete the installation directory before trying again. Otherwise, ask
  for assistance on IRC.
<p>Depending on your OS, here's where to find it:
  <ul>
    <li>Linux: ~/.MCUpdater</li>
    <li>OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/MCUpdater</li>
    <li>Windows: %APPDATA%/.MCUpdater</li>
  </ul>
