IRC is the main support channel, also linked to the server chat. You can use either your own client or IRCCloud to <a href="https://www.irccloud.com/invite?channel=%23erisia&amp;hostname=irc.rizon.net&amp;port=6697&amp;ssl=1" target="_blank">join the #erisia channel on irc.rizon.net,</a> but if you're impatient, you can also use qwebirc below. Note, however, that qwebirc often fails.
