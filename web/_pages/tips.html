<h1>Tips & Tricks for surviving on Erisia 13: <em>Ave Dolor</em></h1>

<p>Erisia 13 runs
the <a href="http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-7-10-terrafirmapunk-2-0-terrafirmacraft-steampunk-adventures.53519/">TerraFirmaPunk</a>
modpack, which is heavily based
on <a href="http://wiki.terrafirmacraft.com/Main_Page">TerraFirmaCraft</a>.

In short, early survival is fairly similar to what it would be on vanilla
TerraFirmaCraft. Here's how:

<p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Run!</em>
  <li>Be prepared. There are monsters behind you. You can't fight them.
  <li>If you dehydrate you'll be unable to run, so keep hydrated. Salt water doesn't work, and drinking from lakes is slow; make clay jugs to carry water with you.
  <li>We have Smart Moving installed. Learn to use it; you'll be able to run
    faster, crawl through holes, and climb up tall ledges, which will help you
    run. Here's
    a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4ITljsRazw">showcase</a>.
  <li>You cannot punch wood; you need, at minimum, an axe. Collect rocks and
    sticks from the ground, then
    learn <a href="http://wiki.terrafirmacraft.com/Knapping">how to bang two rocks
      together</a>.
  <li>Straw blocks line of sight and arrows, but mobs can walk straight through
    it. They're cheap and convenient in early game.
  <li>If you are caught in the open, at night, then dig into a dirt hill and
  block the openings with logs. You cannot use dirt; it'll suffocate you. There
  is nothing else. Wait for the terror to pass.
  <li>You will, eventually, be cornered. If this happens, don't panic; you
    prepared weapons in advance. Axes work well on zombies, but you'll need a
    hammer for the skeleton. Javelins give you an early-game ranged combat
    option. Be careful; stone weapons can only kill one monster on average
    before they break.
  <li>Starvation doesn't immediately kill, but it does weaken you. Collect food!
    There are five food groups, and your max HP depends on how well-fed you
    are. You can read a guide on farming at
    the <a href="http://wiki.terrafirmacraft.com/Agriculture">TerraFirmaCraft
      wiki</a>; it's not like in
    vanilla. <a href="http://wiki.terrafirmacraft.com/Food">Here's</a> a more
    general guide to food.
</ol>

<p>There's quite a bit else to say, but I won't do so here. Check out
the <a href="http://wiki.terrafirmacraft.com/Main_Page">wiki</a>, and/or one of
the many Let's Plays. For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ENgFhyPXHxs?list=PLogHu-UDdQl3B_-hOYHBjYWTHkC2IiLi_">this one</a>.
