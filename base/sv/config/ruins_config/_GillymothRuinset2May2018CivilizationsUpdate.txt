All templates created and developed by Gillymoth aka Ign: lafuller 2015-2018
This set is for any version from 1.9 to 1.12

-------

use these tips when installing Ruins mod to confirm proper installation

    If Ruins is installed:
    breaking a block holding a stick will show the block-name in chat


Gillymoth Diagnostic Tip #2856 (page 143 of Ruins Forum)
    (refined from gillymoth tips #2773 and #2775 from page 138)

    typing "/testruin tester" in the chat will do one of 4 things:

    unknown command <-- the code for ruins is not installed in game
    do not have permission <-- retest in creative mode, set in LAN or use creative test world
    filepath does not exist <-- the folder structure needs to be in place (or just missing the test file)
    a pile of blocks spawns around you <-- success!

===================================================================


<<<<<  All the folders go in the file path:  >>>>>

  in 1.11 or earlier:   mods/resources/ruins

  in 1.12 or later:     config/ruins_config


<<<<< Folders >>>>>  (the list itself is decorative and is not used to call templates)

   Gilly:

    This is where all structures look to find parts to complete the builds.
    This folder contains everything, leave everything in this folder.
    Duplicate any files that are to be moved into biome folders.

   Folders that haven't been listed contain proxy templates to spawn the above structures.
   Extra folders added as a safeguard in case this is run in the version with broken internal biome lists.

==================================================


   This set is updated often, focusing on a few aspects of Facility/Settlement/Civilization for each update.

   This set has evolved over a long time, and builds are being constantly revised and renovated.
   If a build from the most recent set is no longer available, links to all the previous versions
   are still intact, and obsolete structures can be replaced, however they are likely to have been
   rebuilt from scratch for newer sets.


   If any structures become broken in some way, they can be moved to the top of the list for renovations.


  -------------  Update News  -----------


  An elaborate Fishing civilization develops in swamps, spreading along shorelines to the corners of the map,
  where they were promptly eaten by dragons drawn in the margins.

  The plains civilization goes further into decline as inhabitants flock to fishing villages.

  Jungle explorers discover ancient burial grounds in cavelike catacombs, revealing an Aztec wonder,
  cultural influence spreads to savannas, deserts, mesas, and the endermen.

  Elora leads the Ocean explorers.
