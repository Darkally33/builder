These templates are created by Jordan Peacock (AKA Jordan_Greywolf) and Wendy Peacock (AKA Kujaku10) via AtomicStryker's ruins mod.

Updated: 3 Dec 2017

To use, you will need Minecraft (version 1.12), plus AtomicStryker's Ruins mod.

To use these templates, put the folders in the following Minecraft installation folder (exact path may vary depending upon your installation):

*\.minecraft\config\ruins_config\

NOTE: THIS IS A CHANGE FROM EARLIER VERSIONS OF RUINS.

If you're asked to merge folders, go ahead.  This will just add the templates to those currently in the affected biomes folders (possibly overwriting older versions of the same templates).

ADVENTURE - COMMAND BLOCKS:
There may be monsters, there may be traps, there may be treasure, there may be custom-trade villagers, and most assuredly there are going to be lots of Command Blocks.

If you use this on a multiplayer server, be sure to enable command blocks in the system properties.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

SPECIAL NOTE for Versions 1.12 and 1.12.1:
Minecraft version 1.12.1 introduces changes to the biome file naming structure -- and Ruins for that version introduces new block-weight
features.  To accommodate this without having to create a separate ZIP folder for versions 1.12 and 1.12.1, I have some redundant
biome folders, using the alternative biome names for each version.  Templates that only work with 1.12.1 are only included in folders that
have 1.12.1-specific folder names (so they shouldn't be loaded if you're running Minecraft 1.12).

Special Thanks to:

* Gillymoth for help learning the ropes.

* Syndaryl, MentalMouse42, Dooglesmile, and QuarterAnimal for help with bug fixes.

* Kujaku10 for additional templates!

* A1c3e5 for explaining the "/setblock ~ ~ ~ {}" trick for getting data for teBlock rules (such as flower pots).

* ... and especially to AtomicStryker for maintaining and improving my favorite Minecraft mod!  :)

Usage notes for Kujaku10's and JordanGreywolf's templates:

If you have a Minecraft modpack including AtomicStryker's Ruins, you are WELCOME to use any or all of our (Kujaku10's and JordanGreywolf's) templates, and to modify them to best fit your setup.  Please feel free to copy parts of these structures, to borrow ideas for custom mobs, traps, and so forth.  Some of these templates are specifically intended as "proof-of-concept" to share ideas with other Ruins builders.

If you do include these in a modpack, I'd love to hear about it on the Ruins forum thread or via PM.  :)
