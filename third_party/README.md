This directory contains third-party mods that are not on Curse, or for which we wish to distribute a version that isn't, e.g. Prometheus-Integration development builds.

The extraPaintings directory contains pictures for use in Bibliocraft, which are at a minimum permitted to be used noncommercially.

All of these are permitted to be used at least on private servers, and to be stored on GitHub, but not necessarily to be distributed more widely. The copyright in any case belongs to the original author. Do your own research before copying anything from here, and ideally don't; you should be able to get all of these from their original source. The copies in this repository are only permitted to be used for the purpose of playing on Erisia.
