This directory contains third-party mods that are not on Curse, or for which we wish to distribute a version that isn't, e.g. Prometheus-Integration development builds.

The extraPaintings directory contains pictures for use in Bibliocraft, which are at a minimum permitted to be used noncommercially.

The ruins-1.12 directory contains templates for the Ruins mod, made available at http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1282339-1-12-ruins-structure-spawning-system?page=158#c3181
